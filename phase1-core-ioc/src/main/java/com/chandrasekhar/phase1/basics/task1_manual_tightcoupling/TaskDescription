Hands-On Task 1: Without Spring (Tight Coupling)

Objective: Internalize the pain of tight coupling

Task:Create the following classes:

    NotificationService: has a method void send(String message)
    UserService: has a method void registerUser(String username) which:
    Prints "User registered: <username>"
    Sends "Welcome <username>" via NotificationService

ðŸ”’ Constraints:

    Create the NotificationService object inside UserService
    No interfaces or DI
    Run and observe

ðŸ“Œ What You Should Feel:

    Tightly coupled
    Difficult to replace NotificationService or test independently
