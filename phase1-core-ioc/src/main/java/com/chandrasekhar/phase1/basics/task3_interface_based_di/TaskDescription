Task 3: Interface-Based DI with Spring

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:Move toward interface-based design and flexible dependency injection.

ðŸ“Œ Instructions:

    Create an interface INotificationService under a service subpackage
    Implement it in EmailNotificationService (annotated with @Component)
    Update UserService to depend on INotificationService (via constructor)
    Use Spring to wire everything as in Task 2
    Add AppConfig and Main as before

ðŸ”’ Constraint:
    Use only interface type in UserService constructor. No direct class usage.
