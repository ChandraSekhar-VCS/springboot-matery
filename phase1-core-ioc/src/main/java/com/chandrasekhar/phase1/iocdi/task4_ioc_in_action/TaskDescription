TASK 4: IoC Principle in Action

Goal: Show how Spring IoC handles dependency creation, vs traditional approach

Instructions:
    Implement a traditional Java class: TraditionalOrderService that creates PaymentService manually via new
    Then create a Spring-managed version: ModernOrderService where PaymentService is injected
    Log the difference in design and testability in your own notes

Expectation:
    Reflect on what IoC simplifies
    Compare the two approaches in code
