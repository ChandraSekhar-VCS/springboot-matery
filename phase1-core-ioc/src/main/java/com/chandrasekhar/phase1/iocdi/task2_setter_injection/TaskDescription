TASK 2: Setter Injection – Optional Dependency

Goal: Use setter injection for an optional service.

Instructions:
    Create LoggingService with method log(String msg)
    Create AdminService and inject LoggingService via setter
    Call adminService.performAdminTask() – it should optionally log

Expectation:
    Practice setter-based injection
    Null-check inside service (optional dep handling)
