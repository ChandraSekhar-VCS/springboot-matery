ðŸ“Œ Objective
Demonstrate how to define initialization and destruction logic using InitializingBean and DisposableBean interfaces provided by Spring.

âœ… What to Implement
    A class LifecycleInterfaceBean that:
    Implements InitializingBean and overrides afterPropertiesSet().
    Implements DisposableBean and overrides destroy().
    A configuration class AppConfig with @ComponentScan.
    A Main class that:
    Loads the Spring context.
    Retrieves the bean.
    Registers shutdown hook for triggering destroy.

ðŸ§¾ Minimal Instructions
    Implement LifecycleInterfaceBean with proper console printouts in each lifecycle method.
    Annotate with @Component and ensure itâ€™s discovered by component scan.
    Use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext to bootstrap.
    Make sure to call registerShutdownHook() to invoke destroy() automatically.
