Task 1: Bean Scopes â€“ Singleton vs Prototype

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Understand how bean scopes affect object instantiation in the Spring container.

ðŸ§¾ Instructions
    Create two beans:
    One should be @Scope("singleton")
    One should be @Scope("prototype")
    Assign each bean a random UUID during construction.
    In your main class, retrieve each bean twice and print the UUID.

Observe and verify:
    Are the UUIDs same or different for each type?
    What does that indicate about the scope?

ðŸ’¡ Hints:
    Use @Component to register beans.
    Use @Scope("singleton") and @Scope("prototype").
    Use UUID.randomUUID() to track unique identity.
    Use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext to bootstrap.
